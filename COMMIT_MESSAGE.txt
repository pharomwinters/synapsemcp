Fix critical errors in database and server implementations

This commit addresses several critical errors:

1. MariaDB Implementation:
   - Fixed type handling issues with cursor dictionary results
   - Added proper type casting for database query results
   - Improved error handling for database operations
   - Added explicit type annotations for better code safety

2. Utils Module:
   - Fixed type errors in Path constructor calls
   - Added missing get_db_config_from_config() function
   - Fixed string type handling in database operations
   - Improved error handling for configuration access

3. Guide Server:
   - Fixed resource handler error where tool function was incorrectly called
   - Improved guide content access by using the GUIDES dictionary directly

4. Added comprehensive .gitignore file:
   - Python-specific patterns
   - Environment and configuration files
   - Database files
   - IDE and editor files
   - Testing artifacts
   - Cache directories

These changes improve code stability and type safety throughout the Synapse platform.
