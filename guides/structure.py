GUIDE = """## Synapse Structure

The Synapse consists of core files, all in Markdown format:

### Core Files (Required)
1. 'synapse_instructions.md' - Core instructions for using the Synapse system
2. 'projectbrief.md' - High-level project overview and objectives  
3. 'requirements.md' - Detailed technical and functional requirements
4. 'architecture.md' - System architecture and design decisions

### Context Files (Optional)
5. 'timeline.md' - Project timeline, milestones, and deadlines
6. 'meeting_notes.md' - Meeting summaries and action items
7. 'research.md' - Research findings and analysis
8. 'testing.md' - Testing plans, results, and quality assurance
9. 'deployment.md' - Deployment procedures and environment setup
10. 'notes.md' - General notes, ideas, and observations

### File Relationships
Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:
- synapse_instructions.md (foundation)
- projectbrief.md (builds on instructions)
- requirements.md (builds on project brief)
- architecture.md (builds on requirements)
- All context files support and reference the core files

### Reading Order
1. Always start with synapse_instructions.md
2. Read core files in sequence
3. Read relevant context files based on current task
4. Ensure complete understanding before proceeding

This structure ensures AI assistants and humans have consistent, comprehensive project context."""
