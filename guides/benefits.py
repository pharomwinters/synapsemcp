GUIDE = """## Benefits of Synapse

### AI-Human Collaboration
- **Enhanced Intelligence**: AI amplifies human capabilities rather than replacing them
- **Continuous Context**: Maintains project memory across AI assistant resets
- **Collaborative Learning**: Both humans and AI improve through shared knowledge
- **Seamless Integration**: Natural workflow integration for both parties

### Project Management
- **Consistent Context**: Everyone (human and AI) works from the same information
- **Reduced Ramp-up**: New team members and AI assistants get up to speed quickly
- **Decision Tracking**: Rationale behind decisions is preserved
- **Evolution Tracking**: See how projects and requirements evolve over time

### Knowledge Management
- **Centralized Memory**: All project knowledge in one accessible system
- **Structured Information**: Organized files with clear relationships
- **Searchable Content**: Find information quickly across all project documentation
- **Version History**: Track changes and evolution of project understanding

### Development Efficiency
- **Faster Onboarding**: New developers understand the project quickly
- **Reduced Repetition**: Don't re-explain the same concepts repeatedly
- **Better Decisions**: Access to complete context when making choices
- **Consistent Quality**: Shared understanding leads to better outcomes

### Neural Network Metaphor
Like synapses in the brain strengthen connections between neurons, Synapse strengthens connections between human and artificial intelligence, creating a more powerful collaborative system."""
